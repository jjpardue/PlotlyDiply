# PlotlyDiply

This Challenge tasked us to create three various charts using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js. 

I enjoyed this Challenge as it allowed me the opportunity to work more with Javascript and Plotly. Working with these two interfaces is challenging but rewarding as there is a creative element to each. 

The charts are interactive based on the data and each chart is updated respectively to the unique Test Subject ID Number. 

I would like to note that my instructor, Farshad Esnaashari, created a Zoom video which mapped out the first Bar and Bubble chart code and my code for those two charts were largely taken from that resource video. 

Much was learned and I look forward to learning more about Javascript, Plotly and D3.js.

Thank you!
